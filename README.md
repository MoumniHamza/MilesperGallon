Hello world,


This is an app created using Javascript , and what basically it does it receives the users input for the miles driven ,
the gallons consumed and then it returns the mpg for that given day.

It does throw errors if you try to enter strings instead of integers and keeps prompting you until you give the right value or you 
quite the programs.

This program uses all the basics :
   - Variables
   - Conditions
   - loops
   
Thank you guys and have fun !
